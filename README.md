# Audit-Analysis-For-Detecting-Fraudulent-Firms

# Overview
This project focuses on the application of machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent activities within firms by analyzing audit data. The dataset used includes information from 777 firms across six different sectors. The primary objective is to develop a hybrid prediction model combining various machine learning algorithms to identify potential frauds with high accuracy.

# Abstract
The research explores the use of machine learning in the practical context of audit data analysis. The project aims to develop an efficient hybrid prediction model, achieving an accuracy rate of 94.52% and an AUC score of 0.96. The evaluation metrics include accuracy, false positive rate (FP rate), true positive rate (TP rate), F-Measure, error rate, Mathew's Correlation Coefficient (MCC), and AUC.

# Key Features
Utilizes high-dimensional audit data for fraud detection.
Compares ten different classification models, including SVM, Random Forest, J48, Bayes net, and more.
Achieves high accuracy and AUC scores.
Provides a robust framework for predicting audit risks related to fraud.
# Methodology
The proposed framework employs various machine learning classifiers to predict fraudulent activities. The classifiers used include:

Random Forest
Neural Network
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
AdaBoost
Logistic Regression
Decision Stump
J48
Naive Bayes
Bayesian Network
Decision Tree
Dataset
The dataset comprises information from 777 firms across six different sectors. The data underwent rigorous preprocessing, transformation, and refinement to ensure quality and reliability.

# Experimental Setup
The experiments were conducted using the "Weka" suite, which includes features for model building, feature selection, and class balancing techniques. The experiments adhere to a 10-fold cross-validation technique to assess the robustness of the framework.

# Results
The performance of the proposed framework was evaluated using various metrics:

Accuracy
Error Rate
F-Measure
False Positive Rate (FP Rate)
Mathew's Correlation Coefficient (MCC)
Area Under the Curve (AUC)
The results demonstrated that Logistic Regression is currently the best approach for classifying fraudulent firms in audits.

# Conclusion
This research presents a comprehensive case study involving an audit company based in India. It highlights the practical applications of machine learning techniques in predicting and identifying fraudulent firms during the audit planning phase. The proposed framework provides a robust decision support tool for auditors, helping prioritize high-risk firms for extensive audit investigations.

# Future Work
Future research will focus on enhancing the accuracy and effectiveness of predictive models by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and identifying the best-performing models.
